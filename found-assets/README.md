# Found Assets

This repo serves assets required for Found email signatures. It is deployed using Netlify at the following URL: https://found-assets.netlify.com/

## Usage

To reference any of the assets currently in this repo, append the name of the file to the URL:

- To get the `facebook@3x.png` file, use this link:
- `https://found-assets.netlify.com/facebook@3x.png`

- You can then use the URL to get the image when you need it: </br>
`<img src="https://found-assets.netlify.com/facebook@3x.png">`

## Notes

Any new commits to this repo will automatically cause a re-deploy of the site on Netlify, so your assets should be available via the URL after a minute or so. 

Current use of this repo is to serve images for email signatures, but other assets can be added in the future if need be.
